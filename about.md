Hi, I'm pckilgore on Github, and five minute coder is my project to learn the following tech:
* AWS Lamba backend (python) to severlessly generate static user sites served through S3
* API authentication 
* React frontend

Not really taking pull requests on the project right now, but if you see something you'd like to bring to my attention (particularly security problems!) contact me through github!
