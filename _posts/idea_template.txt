In the mornings, we start our blogs by answering:
* what two things have I already programmed that are really great
* I will do two things while I code today to make my code better
* I will do two things while I code today to make my life better
* and a daily affirmation (My code is ...)

In the evening, we answer:
* Two **_awesome_** things I learned while programming today.
* Two things I wish I could have accomplished today.
* How could I have achieved my goals any better today?
