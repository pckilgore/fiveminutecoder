title: welcome to five minute coder
---

This is a blog about building a microblog. We're bootstrapping through Jekyll until we can get a more basic version of things up and running. 

There are two halves to this project:
* tech stack 
* idea stack

We'll describe the tech stack later.  For this first post, the most important concept is the idea stack, because it is how we will be blogging this out in all posts to follow.

## the small idea
We're big fans of [The Five Minute Journal](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal).  Seriously, go check them out--we particularly like and use the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelligentchange.fiveminutejournal&hl=en) (there is an [iOS app too](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/five-minute-journal/id1062945251?mt=8)).  The key insight is to answer several short questions in two sets: one to start the day and one to end it.

For example, in the mornings, you answer (briefly!):
* I am gratefull for (3x)...
* I will do \_\_ to make today great (3x)...
* and a daily affirmation (I am ...) (1x)

In the evening, you answer:
* Three **_amazing_** things things that happened today (3x)...
* How could I have made today even better? (1x)

The general idea is great for all, from mathmaticians to artists. And while we are living proof the general ideas embodied by the Five Minute Journal work for coders, we think a specialized version can really give our productivity and mindfullness a big boost, and really jumpstart blogging about programming.

## current iteration of the small idea
People normally work in threes, but us coders, we like binary.

In the mornings, we start our blogs by answering:
* what two things have I already programmed that are really great
* I will do two things while I code today to make my code better
* I will do two things while I code today to make my life better
* and a daily affirmation (My code is ...)

In the evening, we answer:
* Two **_awesome_** things I learned while programming today.
* Two things I wish I could have accomplished today.
* How could I have achieved my goals any better today?
